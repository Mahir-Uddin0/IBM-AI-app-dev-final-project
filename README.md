# Emotion Detection Web App

## ðŸ“– Project Description

This project is part of the **IBM Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask** course (Module 3 assignment).  
The goal of the project is to build a simple **Emotion Detection Web Application** using Python and Flask.  

The application allows users to enter a text sentence, and it predicts the underlying emotion (such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or neutral) using a pre-trained machine learning model. The project demonstrates how to integrate AI models into a Flask web application, handle user input through a front-end interface, and return predictions in real time.  

This assignment helped reinforce key concepts such as:
- Structuring a Python project for Flask applications.  
- Integrating a machine learning model into a web app.  
- Handling HTTP requests and responses in Flask.  
- Deploying a functional AI-powered application locally.
