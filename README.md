# Emotion Detection Web App

## ðŸ“– Project Description

ðŸ“– Project Description  
This project is part of the IBM *Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask* course (Module 3 assignment). IBM provided the base project skeleton, HTML/CSS templates, and a testing framework, while I implemented the emotion detection functionality by writing the API integration with the Watson NLP Library, processing the responses to extract the dominant emotion, and connecting the backend logic with Flask routes and unit tests.  
  
The goal of the project is to build a simple **Emotion Detection Web Application** using Python, Flask, and Watson NLP Library API.  

The application allows users to enter a text sentence, which is then sent to the **Watson NLP Library API** via a REST API call. The API returns emotion scores, and the Flask backend processes this response to identify the dominant emotion (such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or neutral). The result is then displayed on the web interface in real time. This project demonstrates how to integrate a pre-trained AI model into a Flask web application, handle user input through a front-end interface, and show predictions seamlessly.

This assignment helped reinforce key concepts such as:
- Structuring a Python project for Flask applications.  
- Integrating a machine learning model into a web app.  
- Handling HTTP requests and responses in Flask.  
- Deploying a functional AI-powered application locally.
