# Emotion Detection Web App

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project is part of the **IBM Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask course** (Module 3 assignment). IBM provided the base project skeleton, HTML/CSS templates, and a testing framework, while I implemented the emotion detection functionality by writing the API integration with the Watson NLP Library, processing the responses to extract the dominant emotion, and connecting the backend logic with Flask routes and unit tests.
The goal of the project is to build a simple **Emotion Detection Web Application** using Python and Flask. 

The application allows users to enter a text sentence, and it predicts the underlying emotion (such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or neutral) using a pre-trained machine learning model. The project demonstrates how to integrate AI models into a Flask web application, handle user input through a front-end interface, and return predictions in real time.  

This assignment helped reinforce key concepts such as:
- Structuring a Python project for Flask applications.  
- Integrating a machine learning model into a web app.  
- Handling HTTP requests and responses in Flask.  
- Deploying a functional AI-powered application locally.
